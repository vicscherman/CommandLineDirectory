## Our Task

We will build a command line appilcation for managing employee and organization data. The application will upon initial deployment, allow the user the following minimum functions:

* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update Employee Roles
 
 There are other bonus features that are good to have, but we'll focus on the minimum for this first build.

## Installation

We'll need a couple npm packages installed in order to create and run this program. They're as follows:

* Express - Provides our Server side logic
* Inquirer - for user input in our command line
* My SQL - our database*
* cTable - For making our rendered command line text nice and pretty*
* Figlet - for our sweet ASCII character logo
 

 We'll want to run an npm init, and npm install on all of these in order to use the app.

 ## Usage

 Launch the application in the command line by navigating to the app.js directory, and using

 ``
 node app.js

 ``

 Then follow the onscreen prompts depending on what you want to do in the application.
